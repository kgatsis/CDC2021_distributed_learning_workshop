        <p>  Advances in faster and more reliable networking and computing infrastructure, as well as their wider availability, have been driving cyber-physical systems to become increasingly networked. The control systems community has been leading these efforts, with fundamental results in topics such as distributed optimization and control, networked control, and multi-agent systems being developed. Concurrently, there is a revolution in machine learning techniques that allow extraction of useful information and models from data. Given that it is difficult to obtain accurate models for large scale networked cyber-physical systems, over the last years it has been recognized that networked cyber-physical systems will become increasingly data-driven. A natural question then is whether networked cyber-physical system control can exploit developments in machine learning algorithms, and concomitantly, drive advances in machine learning. The purpose of this workshop is to explore the fundamental research questions that arise at the intersection of these areas.

            <div id="Nedich" style="display:none">
            <p><strong>Abstract: </strong> We will overview the distributed optimization algorithms starting with the basic underlying idea illustrated on a prototype problem in machine learning. In particular, we will focus on convex minimization problem where the objective function is given as the sum of convex functions, each of which is known by an agent in a network. The agents communicate over the network with a task to jointly determine a minimum of the sum of their objective functions. The communication network can vary over time, which is modeled through a sequence of graphs over a static set of nodes (representing the agents in a system). In this setting, the distributed first-order methods will be discussed that make use of an agreement protocol, which is a mechanism replacing the role of a coordinator. We will discuss some refinements of the basic method and conclude with more recent developments of fast methods that can match the performance of centralized methods (up to a logarithmic factor). </p>

            <div id="Hassani" style="display:none">
            <p><strong>Abstract: </strong> We consider a standard federated learning architecture where a group of clients periodically coordinate with a central server to train a statistical model. We tackle two major challenges in federated learning:(i) objective heterogeneity, which stems from differences in the clients' local loss functions, and (ii) systems heterogeneity, which leads to slow and straggling client devices. Due to such client heterogeneity, we show that existing federated learning algorithms suffer from a fundamental speed-accuracy conflict: they either guarantee linear convergence but to an incorrect point, or convergence to the global minimum but at a sub-linear rate, ie, fast convergence comes at the expense of accuracy.
To address the above limitation, we propose FedLin-a simple, new algorithm that exploits past gradients and employs client-specific learning rates. When the clients' local loss functions are smooth and strongly convex, we show that FedLin guarantees linear convergence to the global minimum. We then establish matching upper and lower bounds on the convergence rate of FedLin that highlight the trade-offs associated with infrequent, periodic communication. Notably, FedLin is the only approach that is able to match centralized convergence rates (up to constants) for smooth strongly convex, convex, and non-convex loss functions despite arbitrary objective and systems heterogeneity. We further show that FedLin preserves linear convergence rates under aggressive gradient sparsification, and quantify the effect of the compression level on the convergence rate. </p>

            <div id="Doan" style="display:none">
            <p><strong>Abstract: </strong> The confluence of two powerful global trends - the rapid development of computational technology and the large amount of collected data - has enabled data-driven decision making in large-scale complex systems. Prominent examples include autonomous driving, robotics, data center, and manufacturing. The key challenge in these systems is in handling the vast quantities of information shared between the agents to find an optimal policy that maximizes or minimizes the agents’ objectives. This task needs to be done under computation and communication constraints. Among potential approaches, distributed algorithms, which is not only amenable to low-cost implementation but can also be implemented in real time, has been recognized as an important approach to address this challenge.
In this talk, I will discuss about our recent work in developing distributed two-time-scale stochastic approximation for solving optimization problems over multi-agent systems under communication constraints. Two-time-scale stochastic approximation, a generalized version of the classic stochastic approximation, has broad applications in many areas, including stochastic optimization and reinforcement learning. We developed distributed two-time-scale stochastic gradient methods for solving networked optimization and show that our methods can handle both quantized communication and network latency. We provide an explicit formula to characterize the convergence rates of our methods as a function of network topology and communication capacity. I will conclude my talk with some discussion on the applications of two-time-scale methods in networked control and optimization. </p>

            <div id="Basar" style="display:none">
            <p><strong>Abstract: </strong> Recent years have witnessed significant advances in reinforcement learning (RL), which has registered tremendous success in solving various sequential decision-making problems in machine learning. Most of the successful RL applications today involve the participation of multiple agents, which naturally fall into the realm of multi-agent RL (MARL), a domain which has recently witnessed resurgence due to advances in single agent deep RL techniques. Even though empirically successful, theoretical foundations for MARL are relatively few in the literature, and their development constitutes exciting and promising avenues of research. This talk will provide a selective overview of decentralized MARL with networked agents, with focus on algorithms backed by theoretical analysis. In such a setting, multiple agents perform sequential decision-making in an environment common to them, and without the coordination of any central controller, while being allowed to exchange information with their neighbors over a communication network. Thus, each agent makes individual decisions based on both the information observed locally and the messages received from its neighbors over the underlying network, which could have a time-varying topology. In terms of the objectives of the agents, the presentation will cover fully cooperative and fully competitive behaviors, as well as a blend of the two, which captures a scenario where two teams of agents compete in a zero-sum game setting, while the agents within each team collaborate by exchanging information over the communication network. The general framework of decentralized MARL with networked agents has broad applications in diverse domains, such as control and operation of robots, unmanned vehicles, mobile sensor networks, and the smart grid. </p>

            <div id="Li" style="display:none">
            <p><strong>Abstract: </strong> In this talk, we present some of our recent results in studying the performance of the gradient play algorithm for stochastic games (SGs), where each agent tries to maximize its own total discounted reward by making decisions independently based on current state information which is shared between agents. Policies are directly parameterized by the probability of choosing a certain action at a given state. We show that Nash equilibria (NEs) and first-order stationary policies are equivalent in this setting, and give a local convergence rate around strict NEs. Further, for a subclass of SGs called Markov potential games (which includes the cooperative setting with identical rewards among agents as an important special case), we design a sample-based reinforcement learning algorithm and give a non-asymptotic global convergence rate analysis for both exact gradient play and our sample-based learning algorithm. Local geometry and local stability are also considered, where we prove that strict NEs are local maxima of the total potential function and fully-mixed NEs are saddle points.

            <div id="Trimpe" style="display:none">
            <p><strong>Abstract: </strong> The ability to learn is an essential aspect of autonomous systems facing uncertain and changing environments.  However, the process of learning a new model or behavior often does not come for free, but involves a certain cost.  For example, gathering informative data can be challenging due to physical limitations, or updating models can require substantial computation.  Moreover, learning for autonomous agents often requires exploring new behavior and thus typically means deviating from nominal or desired behavior.  Hence, the question of "when to learn?" is essential for the efficient and intelligent operation of autonomous systems.  We have recently proposed the concept of event-triggered learning (ETL) for making principled decisions on when to learn new dynamics models.  Building on the core idea of learning only when necessary, we haved developed concrete triggers and theory for different domains.  In the context of networked and interconnected systems, ETL leads to superior communication savings over standard event-triggered control.  For linear quadratic control, ETL automatically detects inaccurate models and yields improved control performance under changing dynamics.  In this talk, we present the concept, theoretical results, and experimental applications of ETL.  </p>
